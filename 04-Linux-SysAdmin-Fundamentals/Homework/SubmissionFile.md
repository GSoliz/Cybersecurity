### Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 /etc/gshadow

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 640 /etc/group

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/passwd

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users): sudo useradd sam, sudo useradd joe, sudo useradd amy, sudo useradd sara, sudo useradd admin

2. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.  

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group: sudo usermod -a -G sudo admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: sudo groupadd engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users): sudo usermod -a -G engineers sam, sudo usermod -a -G engineers joe, sudo usermod -a -G engineers amy, sudo usermod -a -G engineers sara,

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: sudo mkdir -p /home/engineers

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: sudo chmod -R 775 /home/engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: sudo apt-get install lynis -y

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: sudo lynis --help

3. Command to run an audit: sudo lynis audit system

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.
